As we were coming down the hill we accidentally flushed them. There was one snow goose in the bunch. It was similar in size to the Canada geese (who were too large to be cackling geese, and had the flight calls of canada geese as well). Snow goose was very white with black primaries. As the flock was flying away from us onto the water, we were unable to see the goose's bill.    Perhaps a complete coincidence, but the last time we birded Standley Lake North, we found a snow goose with a small group of Canada geese in the same spot (checklist: http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID&#61;S16160721). On that occasion, we were able to view the birds on the ground and definitively ID the goose as a snow goose."
